      "p1": "I'm an experienced Frontend Developer with a deep focus on building scalable, high-performance web applications using modern technologies. My primary stack includes React, Next.js, and TypeScript, along with a strong command of state management tools like Redux, Zustand, and React Query. I'm highly experienced with asynchronous data handling, SSR/SSG, and real-time updates via tools like WebSockets and Socket.io.",
      "p2": "Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to and led frontend development on a wide range of applications - from internal enterprise dashboards to real-time platforms and public-facing products - working with varied architectures such as monoliths, micro-frontends, and modular design systems. I've worked both independently and in collaboration with backend, design, and product teams, adapting quickly to different workflows and team dynamics.",
      "p3": "I’m passionate about clean, type-safe, and maintainable code, and I constantly aim to improve performance, developer experience, and code structure. Whether it's optimizing rendering, reducing bundle size, refactoring for clarity, or implementing scalable patterns, I approach problems with a balance of technical precision and pragmatic decision-making."

В работе активно использую современные подходы к управлению состоянием (Redux, Zustand, React Query), умею эффективно работать с асинхронными процессами, SSR/SSG, а также real-time обновления (WebSocket, socket.io).",
      "p2": "За свою карьеру принимал участие в разработке различных проектов: от внутренних корпоративных платформ до публичных сервисов и high-load приложений. Работал с разными архитектурами - монолитами, микрофронтендами, разделёнными слоями, а также с дизайном гибких и переиспользуемых UI-систем. Имею опыт как самостоятельной разработки с нуля, так и тесного взаимодействия в мультидисциплинарных командах.",
      "p3": "Особое внимание уделяю чистоте и читаемости кода, оптимизации производительности и удобству поддержки. Всегда стараюсь строить решения с прицелом на масштабирование, гибкость и комфорт как для пользователей, так и для команды разработки."
